# 1. Machine Learning

## 1.1 What is Machine Learning ?
Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is concerned with building algorithms which , to be useful , rely on collection of
examples of some phenomenon . These examples can come from nature , be hancrafted by humans or generated by
another algorithm .
## 1.2 Types of Learning
Learning can be supervised , semi-supervised , unsupervised and reinforcement

### 1.2.1 Supervised Learning
In supervised learning , the dataset is a  collection of labeled examples $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$.Each element
$X_i$ among N is called a feature vector. A feature vector is a vector in which each dimension j = 1,...,D
contains a value that describes the example somehow.The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to use
the dataset to produce a model that takes a feature vector $X$ as input and outputs information that allows
deducing the label for this feature vector .

### 1.2.2 Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning , the dataset is a collection of unlabeled examples $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$. Again ,
$X$ is a feature vector , and the goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to create a model that
takes a feature vector $X$ as input and either transforms it into another vector or into a value that can
be used to solve a practical problem.

### 1.2.3 Semi-Supervised Learning
In semi-supervised learning , the dataset contains both labeled and unlabeled examples.Usually , the quantity
of unlabeled examples is much higher than the number of labeled examples.The goal of a semi-supervised
learning algorithm is to hope that using many unlabeled examples can help the learning algorithm to find a
better model

### 1.2.4 Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning where the machine lives in an environment and is capable of
perceiving the state fo that environment as a vector of features .The machine can execute actions in every
state. Different actions bring different rewards and could also move the machine to another state of the
environment.The goal of a reinforcement learning algorithm is to learn a policy. A policy is a function $f$
that takes the feature vector of a state as input and outputs an optimal actiont to execute in that state.
